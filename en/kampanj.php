                    <b>Day 1 - Töreboda - Sjötorp - Norrqvarn 27 km (17 miles)</b>
The day starts as you collect your bikes and your picnic baskets here at café «Visthuset». On your way to Sjötorp, you will pass several locks which are set in beautiful nature that is just starting to wake up from its winter's sleep. The whole way goes slightly downhill right next to the canal and easy to bike on. For most of the route you will be biking on paths that are free from automobile traffic. 
<br><br>
First goal for the day is the little village Sjötorp, wich is the harbour of the «Göta canal» facing the lake «Vänern». In the old days, this was the place were the boats and freighters were build and repaired. You will also find a little museum about the «Göta Canal» here, were you can learn more about the construction and usage of the canal. This museum is surely worth a visit! When you reach the hotel «Norrqvarn» at the end of the day, your dinner will be served there. You will be enjoying three courses of locally produced dishes which will give you a selection of the tastes of this region. During the night you will be staying in one of the hotel’s comfortable rooms, so that you can start refreshed into the next day.
